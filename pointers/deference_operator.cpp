/*
Dereference Operator *
An interesting property of pointers is that they can be used to access the variable they point to directly. This is done by preceding the pointer name with the dereference operator(*). The operator itself can be read as "value pointed to by"

/*
NULL pointer:
Sometimes it is useful to make our point to nothing. This is called a null pointer.
