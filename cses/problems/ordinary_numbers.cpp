Let's call a positive integer n
 ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example, 1
, 2
 and 99
 are ordinary numbers, but 719
 and 2021
 are not ordinary numbers.
 
 For a given number n
, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from 1
 to n
.

Input
The first line contains one integer t
 (1≤t≤104
). Then t
 test cases follow.

Each test case is characterized by one integer n
 (1≤n≤109
).

Output
For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from 1
 to n


 Tutorial:
 Note that every ordinary number can be represented as d⋅(100+101+…+10k)
. Therefore, to count all ordinary numbers among the numbers from 1
 to n
, it is enough to count the number of (d,k)
 pairs such that d⋅(100+101+…+10k)≤n
. In the given constraints, it is enough to iterate over d
 from 1
 to 9
 and k
 from 0
 to 8
.
